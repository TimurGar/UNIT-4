# Class exercise
Today in the Computer Science class, we were applying the knowledge that we learned about network devices 
and network topic in general by setting up a LAN(local area network). We had such network devices as:
* Router
* 2 Switches
* Wireless access point
* Ethernet cables
* Ethernet to usb type-A adapters
* Power cables

We first connected router and switches to electrical outlets in order to power them. Then, we used ethernet cabels to connect switches to a router. 
By doing that we will be much more devices to our network as switches gives as an oppotunity to expand ethernet ports. After that we also used ethernet cables 
and ethernet to usb type-A adapters to connect our devices(laptops) to our local network. We also connected a wireless access point to our network but since our router
wasn't connected to modem we didn't have the internet. 

In my opinion, this exercise was very useful as I was able to use my theoretical knowledge in practice.

After, we set up everything, we created the following network diagram:
